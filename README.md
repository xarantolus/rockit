# rockit
Rock It! is an Android app that helps you stay informed on all things space. It displays upcoming launches and current space news curated by [The Space Devs](https://thespacedevs.com/).


### Features
- List upcoming launches and events (e.g. space station activity)
- Show launch/event details and a countdown
- List latest space news articles
- Localization for English and German (UI only, data is in English)
- No internet? No problem! The app caches offline content for a few days and updates it when connected to the internet

### Anti-Features
There's also one [Anti-Feature](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/AntiFeatures) as defined by F-Droid: this app connects to [Non-Free Network Services](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/#NonFreeNet) because it needs to get launch data.

### Credits
All data this app uses is curated by [The Space Devs](https://thespacedevs.com/). This app uses the [Launch Library 2](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) and [Spaceflight News](https://thespacedevs.com/snapi) APIs.
